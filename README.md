# Droppers
My first complete game, made in the graphics programming language Processing (based in Java). It
involves a menu system programmed from scratch, a highscore system, and the main game where
the player must dodge as many falling shapes as possible, as they fall faster and faster.

The source code for Processing projects (Droppers and PiApproxLite) are contained in .pde files.
These can just be opened and read with any text editor. The code within is still essentially Java code.
